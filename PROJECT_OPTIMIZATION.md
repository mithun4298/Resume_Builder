# Resume Builder Project: Current Architecture & Optimization Ideas

## Current State

- **Client-side resume editing, preview, and PDF export**
  - All resume editing, preview, and PDF export are handled in the browser (no server-side PDF generation).
- **Minimal server-side logic**
  - Server is responsible for authentication, user session management, and storing/retrieving user and resume data from the database.
- **In-memory user cache for authentication**
  - Reduces repeated DB lookups for active sessions (5-minute TTL).
- **Minimal session data**
  - Only user ID and tokens are stored in the session, not large objects.
- **Database is queried only when needed**
  - On login, and when fetching or saving resumes.
- **Security best practices**
  - Authentication via secure sessions and OAuth (Google OIDC).
  - User input is handled safely.

## Further Optimization Ideas

1. **API Rate Limiting**
   - Prevent abuse and reduce server load by limiting requests per user/IP.
2. **Database Indexing**
   - Ensure indexes on user and resume tables for faster queries.
3. **Resume Data Compression**
   - Compress large resume data before storing in the DB (if resumes get big).
4. **Static Asset Optimization**
   - Use a CDN for static files (images, JS, CSS) to reduce server bandwidth.
5. **Lazy Loading**
   - Load resume templates and assets only when needed.
6. **Monitoring & Alerts**
   - Add monitoring (e.g., Prometheus, Sentry) to catch performance or security issues early.
7. **Session Store Optimization**
   - Use a distributed session store (like Redis) if you scale to multiple servers.
8. **Client-Side Caching**
   - Cache resume data/templates in the browser for faster UX.
9. **Progressive Web App (PWA)**
   - Make the app installable and usable offline for even better performance.
